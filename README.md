Coursework for the Neural Computation Module.
Canvas course: https://canvas.bham.ac.uk/courses/27504


DONE SO FAR:
1. Applied the network to our own data.
2. Altered code to read our inputs.
3. Applied a pretrained network to a test image (output as a .png)

TO DO (CHANGE BY ED):
1. Output files into the correct format of a single .txt file.
2. Implement all the code into python if possible.
3. Generate report on findings on a jupyter notebook
4. Try different approaches and experimentation:

4.a. Different learning rates for SGD

4.b. Different optimization algorithms (GD with Momentum, GD with Nesterov Momentum, AdaGrad, Adam etc.)

4.c. Different topology e.g. Convolutional Neural Networks
