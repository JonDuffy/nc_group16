    "### Introduction\n",
    "For this task we look into using a neural network to classify and localise objects in images. We have X number of preprocessed training images of dimension 400x400 pixels, each of which are paired with a text file that specify classes and, if present, bounding boxes around a present object in that image. These images are from the VOC data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also have Y number of testing images of the same format. Our task is to accurately generate an accompanying text file, which specifies the classes and, if present, bounding boxes of all the test images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the text file for image 2007_000027. Here we can see 20 classes.\n",
    "The “1 0” following the class name indicates that this class is not present in the image.\n",
    "If an object has been detected, the numbers that follow indicate the bounding box with pixel references. The pixels are numbered from top to bottom, then left to right. For example, 1 is pixel (1,1), 2 is pixel (2,1), etc. The numbers are paired such that the first number represents the starting pixel and the second represents how many consecutive pixels after this. This creates a bounding box around our objects."
